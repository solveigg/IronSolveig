Long definition,,,,,
"Population density is midyear population divided by land area in square kilometers. Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship--except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.",,,,,

"GNI, Atlas method (current US$)",,,,,
Long definition,,,,,
"GNI (formerly GNP) is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. Data are in current U.S. dollars. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",,,,,

"GNI, PPP (current international $)",,,,,
Long definition,,,,,
"This indicator provides values for gross national income (GNI. Formerly GNP) expressed in current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor. Gross national income is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. PPP conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that eliminates the effects of the differences in price levels between countries. From July 2020, “GNI: linked series (current LCU)” [NY.GNP.MKTP.CN.AD] is used as underlying GNI in local currency unit so that it’s in line with time series of PPP conversion factors, which are extrapolated with linked deflators.",,,,,
